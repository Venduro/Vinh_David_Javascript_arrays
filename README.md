Arrays Challenge
Create an array with five decimal numbers, and use it for the following:

Find the highest number. (Hint: create a variable called max, and assign it a reasonable start value; then use forEach: if an element is higher than max, change max).
Find the lowest number.
Find the smallest number (the closest to zero).
Calculate the sum.
Create a function that calculates and returns the sum of an array.
Calculate the mean value.
Find the index of the highest number.
Create an array with your siblings names, and an array with your parents names.

Sort your siblings names in alphabetical order.
Sort your parents names in reverse alphabetical order.
Sort all the names in alphabetical order. (Hint) Combine the arrays into a single array.)
Sort all the names in reverse alphabetical order.
Create a function that returns all the names in reverse alphabetical order in one String.
Create a function that determines if a given name is amongst the names.
Create an array with five integer numbers, and use it for the following:

Create a function that returns an array with only the even elements from the array (Hint: use the % operator). * What happens if there are no even numbers?
Create a function that returns an array with only the odd elements from the array.
Explain why the following program outputs what it does:
var a = [1,2,3];
var b = [4,5,6];
a + b;
Result: "1,2,34,5,6"
